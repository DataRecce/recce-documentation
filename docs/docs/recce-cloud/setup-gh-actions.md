!!! Note

    Recce Cloud is currently in **private alpha** and scheduled for general availability later this year.  [Sign up](../../cloud.md#signup) to the Recce newsletter to be notified, or email [product@datarecce.io](mailto:product@datarecce.io) to join our design partnership program for early access.

[Continuous Integration(CI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) and [Continuous Delivery(CD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery) are best practices in software development. Through CI automation, a dbt project can systematically and continuously deliver and integrate high-quality results.

To automate the process, we can use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) to provide an automated and reusable workspace. The following diagram describes the entire ci/cd architecture.

![alt text](../../assets/images/recce-cloud/setup-architecture.png){: .shadow}

We suggest setting up two GitHub Actions workflows in your GitHub repository. One for the base environment and another for the PR environment.

- **Base environment workflow**: Triggered on every merge to the `main branch`. This ensures that base dbt artifacts are readily available for use.

- **PR environment workflow**: Triggered on every push to the `pull-request branch`. This workflow will compare base models with the current PR environment.

## Prerequisites

1.  **Per-PR Environment**: To ensure that each PR has its own isolated environment, it is recommended to put `profile.yml` under source control in the repository and use environment variables to change the schema name. In the workflow, we can generate the corresponding schema name based on the PR number.

    ```yaml
    myprofile:
      outputs:
        pr:
          type: snowflake
          ...
          schema: "{{ env_var('DBT_SCHEMA') | as_text }}"
        prod:
          type: snowflake
          ...
          schema: PUBLIC
    ```

2.  **GitHub Token** and **Recce State Password**: As mentioned [here](index.md#prerequisite), please ensure that the two secrets are available when running recce commands. You can add `GH_TOKEN` and `RECCE_STATE_PASSWORD` to the [GitHub Actions Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions). Then we can use them in the Github Actions workflow file.
    ```yaml
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
      RECCE_STATE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.RECCE_STATE_PASSWORD }}
    ```

!!!warning

    You cannot use the [automatic generated token](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication) here, because we need the personal access token (PAT) to verify if the user has PUSH permission of the repository.

    ```yaml
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # Don't use 'secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN' here
    ```

## Set up Recce with GitHub Actions

### Prepare base dbt artifacts

For dbt Core users:

  1. Run dbt on the base environment.
  2. Use the GitHub Action workflow below.
    1. Build base dbt artifacts
    2. Upload dbt artifacts to Recce Cloud

Upload the base dbt artifact to Recce Cloud by `recce cloud upload-artifacts`. 
You and other developers on your team can then download by `recce cloud download-base-artifacts` without building base artifacts every time. 

!!! note

    Please place the above file in `.github/workflows/dbt_base.yml`. This workflow path will also be used in the next PR workflow. If you place it in a different location, please remember to make the corresponding changes in the next step.

```yaml
name: Daily Job

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * *"
  push:
    branches:
      - main

concurrency:
  group: recce-ci-base
  cancel-in-progress: true
env:
  # Credentials used by dbt profiles.yml
  DBT_USER: ${{ secrets.DBT_USER }}
  DBT_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.DBT_PASSWORD }}
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: "3.10.x"
          cache: "pip"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          pip install recce

      - name: Run DBT
        run: |
          dbt deps
          dbt seed --target ${{ env.DBT_BASE_TARGET }}
          dbt run --target ${{ env.DBT_BASE_TARGET }}
          dbt docs generate --target ${{ env.DBT_BASE_TARGET }}
        env:
          DBT_BASE_TARGET: "prod"

      - name: Upload DBT Artifacts
        run: |
          recce cloud upload-artifacts
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
          RECCE_STATE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.RECCE_STATE_PASSWORD}}
```

For dbt Cloud users running CI/CD:

  1. For unscheduled production jobs: Use a GitHub Action workflow (coming soon) to trigger the job. The workflow will [download dbt artifacts](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cloud/api-v2#/operations/Retrieve%20Run%20Artifact) and upload them to Recce Cloud.
  2. For scheduled production jobs: Use a GitHub Action workflow (coming soon) to [download dbt artifacts](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cloud/api-v2#/operations/Retrieve%20Run%20Artifact) and upload them to Recce Cloud.
    - Note: The GitHub Action workflow is triggered after the dbt Cloud job, so there may be some latency.

### PR Workflow (Pull Request Branch)

This workflow will perform the following actions:

1. Run dbt on the PR environment.
2. Download previously generated base artifacts from base workflow.
3. Use Recce to compare the PR environment with the downloaded base artifacts.
4. Use Recce to generate the summary of the current changes and post it as a comment on the pull request. Please refer to the [Recce Summary](../features/recce-summary.md) for more information.

### PR workflow with dbt Cloud

We can download the dbt artifacts from dbt Cloud for Recce if CI/CD on dbt Cloud is configured. The basic scenario is to download the latest artifacts of the deploy job for the base environment and the artifacts of the CI job for the current environment. We can archieve it via [dbt Cloud API](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cloud/api-v2#/) and we need:

1. [dbt Cloud Token](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/user-tokens)
1. dbt Cloud Account ID: Check out your "Account settings" on dbt Cloud
1. dbt Cloud Deploy Job ID: Check out "API trigger" of the deploy job
1. dbt Cloud CI Job ID: Check out "API trigger" of the CI job

![alt text](../../assets/images/recce-cloud/dbt-cloud-api-trigger.png){: .shadow }

We prepare a GitHub Action ["Recce dbt Cloud Action"](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/recce-dbt-cloud-action) to do the following steps:

1. Trigger the CI job on dbt Cloud
1. Wait the CI job to finish
1. Download the dbt artifacts from the deploy job to `./target-base` directory
1. Download the dbt artifacts from the deploy job to `./target` directory

Check out the [GitHub Action](GitHub Action page for complete) to configure the GitHub workflow.

!!! note

    Please ensure `Generate docs on run` is toggled in the "Execution settings" of deploy job and "Advanced settings" of CI job.

## Review the Recce State File

**Review locally**

```bash
git checkout <pr-branch>
recce server --cloud --review
```

**Review in the GitHub codespace**

Please see [GitHub Codespaces](./setup-gh-codespaces.md) integration.
