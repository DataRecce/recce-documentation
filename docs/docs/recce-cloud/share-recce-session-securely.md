## Share your validation results with anyone, no setup needed

If you've already used Recce to validate your PR and prepared checks, but stakeholders might not have the environment to run Recce.

Recce Cloud allows you to share your Recce validation results with full context, using a simple link. Stakeholders can open a read-only Recce view directly in their browser. No installation, no configuration, just instant access.

!!! Note

    Please note that anyone with the link can visit your shared Recce after sign in Recce Cloud. If you need to restrict access, [please contact us](https://cal.com/team/recce/chat).

## How to use

When you're ready to share your lineage exploration, query results, or validation checklist, simply click **Share** in Recce.

The first time you do this, you'll need to connect your local Recce to Recce Cloud. This requires signing in and setting up an API token. Once connected, Recce Cloud will host your state file securely, allowing you to share a link that others can open in their browsers.

1. Enable Recce Sharing

    To start sharing, launch Recce server and click the **Enable Sharing** button.

1. Sign in to Recce Cloud and get your API token

    Copy your API token from the [personal settings page](https://cloud.datarecce.io/settings#tokens) in Recce Cloud.

1. Add the token to `.recce/profile.yml`

    For convenience, you can add your API token in `.recce/profile.yml`, located by default in your home directory. 
    ```yaml
    user_id: <your_user_id>
    api_token: <your_api_token>
    ```
    Alternatively, for one-time use, you can use `--api-token` flag with commend. e.g.,
    ```bash
    recce server --api-token <your_api_token>
    ```

1. Relaunch Recce server

    After adding the API token, restarting Recce server is required to load the new configuration.
    Once it's running, you'll see the **Share** button, then you can click it to get the link on top.

    You can also use the `recce share` command. If you already have a prepared Recce state file, you can obtain a share link directly through the command line.
    ```bash
    recce share <your_state_file>
    recce share --api-token <your_api_token> <your_state_file>  # for one-time use
    ```
